<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



The App Is Mainly Designed To Create A Health Profile For Every User,Such That They Or Their Consultant (if user wants) Could See Their Medical History,Details And Background At A Single Click.
We Usually Observe That People Dont Take Care Of Their Medical Prescriptions Or Reports.And When They Need In Future,They Could Not Discover It.This We Took As A Problem Statement And From Here The Idea Of Medi-Mitra Was Born.

Here's why:
* For doctors and hospitals, the app serve as a secure platform for storing and sharing important medical documents, such as treatment plans, test results, and progress reports
* the app  serve as a social media platform for hospitals, allowing them to share updates and information with patients and the general public
* For patients, the app can provide easy access to their own medical records and the ability to share these documents with other healthcare providers or family members as needed.

OVERALL app can help improve communication and collaboration within the healthcare system, leading to better outcomes for patients and more efficient care for all.
